# **Product Recommendation System Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project is a machine learning-based product recommendation system aimed at enhancing the accuracy of product recommendations on Amazon's platform. The system utilizes a structured approach to process data, engineer features, and apply advanced machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences, offering personalized product suggestions.

## **Features**
- **Product Review Preprocessing:** 
  - Data is cleaned and prepared to ensure the accuracy of the models.
  
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Key features are derived from the data to capture important patterns relevant to product recommendations.
  
- **Algorithm Selection:**
  - A variety of machine learning algorithms are employed to improve the recommendation accuracy, including:
    - **Support Vector Classification (SVC):** Effective for creating boundaries between classes in a high-dimensional space.
    - **Random Forest:** Utilizes multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance.
    - **Gradient Boosting:** Sequentially optimizes weak learners to minimize errors and enhance model accuracy.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**
  - Models are trained using the processed and engineered data, and their performance is evaluated using standard metrics to determine the best-performing algorithm.
