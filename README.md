# **Product Recommendation System Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project is a machine learning-based product recommendation system that suggests products to users based on their input or previous preferences. The system utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze product reviews, transforming them into features that can be used to find similar products.

## **Features**
- **Product Review Preprocessing:** 
  - Removes noise such as special characters and stopwords.
  - Lemmatizes words to ensure consistency in word forms.
  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:**
  - Converts the processed product reviews into numerical feature vectors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
  
- **Cosine Similarity Calculation:**
  - Computes similarities between products based on their TF-IDF vectors to find the most relevant recommendations.

- **Product Recommendation:**
  - Suggests a list of similar products based on an input product name.
